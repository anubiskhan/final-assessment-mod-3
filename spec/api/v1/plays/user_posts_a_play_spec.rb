# Background: This story assumes the base data from running `rake db:seed`
#
# You can choose to send the user_id and word specified below however you'd like or are comfortable.
#
# When I send a POST request to "/api/v1/games/1/plays" with a user_id=1 and word=at
# Then I should receive a 201 Created Response
#
# When I send a GET request to "/api/v1/games/1" I receive a JSON response as follows:
#
# {
#   "game_id":1,
#   "scores": [
#     {
#       "user_id":1,
#       "score":17
#     },
#     {
#       "user_id":2,
#       "score":16
#     }
#   ]
# }
